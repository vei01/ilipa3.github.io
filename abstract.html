        Indonesia is one of the most polluted countries in the world. Air pollution in Indonesia, especially in Jakarta can cause many negative impacts such as health problems. Air pollution can cause global warming. Air pollution is the presence of one or more physical, chemical or biological substances in the atmosphere in quantities that may harm human, animal and plant health, interfere with aesthetics and comfort, or damage property. Air pollution can be caused by natural sources or human activities. Global warming is climate change which refers to changes in temperature and weather patterns in the long term resulting in an increase in the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. This will make the forest bare and the resulting smoke will pollute the water, soil and air. In addition, the manufacture of energy for human daily life is also a factor in increasing the greenhouse gas effect. Basically, the energy used by humans has actually been provided and already exists in nature, so that humans themselves can get it directly.Alternative energy itself is one of the efforts of humans to reduce global warming.Humans have their own goals and reasons to find out more about alternative energy like wind turbine .Wind movement usually occurs from high areas to low areas, so that it can cause the air temperature in an area to be different.Indonesia itself has the potential for a wind power plant (PLTB) of 60.6 GW, but currently there is still very little potential that has been utilized by the government. In this research, we are  focusing on ways to reduce global warming, more precisely reducing air pollution. We hope this simulation experiment could help reduce air pollution.
